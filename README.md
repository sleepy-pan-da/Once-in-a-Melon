## Description
### How to play?
- Your character will keep moving in one direction
- Control your character's movement with 3 keys (a - face left, d - face right, w - jump) 
- Equip your character with weapons by touching crate boxes
- Use the equipped weapons by 
    - pressing 'left arrow key' if character is facing left
    - pressing 'right arrow key' if character is facing right
- **Be the last one standing to win!**

### Motivation
We wanted to create a multiplayer game with high depth and minimalistic controls. 
Some references that we took include
- Towerfall Ascension
- Nidhogg

### Technology used
Godot engine - We felt that this engine was more suitable for this project as it's a 2d game. Using Godot would allow for faster development

### Challenges faced
This was our first time developing games together. We had to identify independent components in the game to allow for simultaneous development. Communication was important as well when integrating our components together. 

## How to install the game?
- Git clone this repo
- Go to the ToPlayGame file
- Open the exe file to play!
